# O9KClock

This is a library which implements a high-precision real-time clock, by
combining the separate real-time and high-precision clocks provided by the
operating system.

Since the two clocks provided by the operating system may not have the exact
same frequency, O9KClock uses the real-time clock to govern the frequency of
the combined clock, but uses the high-precision clock to attain precision.

## Usage

The `O9K::Clock` class implements a basic clock interface, supporting sampling
as well as the registration of callbacks based on time.

## Supported platforms / recommended toolchains

This is a portable C++11 application which depends only on the C++11 compiler,
the C and C++ standard libraries, and other C++11 libraries with similar
dependencies, so it should be supported on almost any platform.  The following
are recommended toolchains for popular platforms.

* Windows -- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Microsoft Visual C++)
* Linux -- clang or gcc
* MacOS -- Xcode (clang)

## Building

This library is not intended to stand alone.  It is intended to be included in a larger solution which uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate the build system and build applications which will link with the library.

There are two distinct steps in the build process:

1. Generation of the build system, using CMake
2. Compiling, linking, etc., using CMake-compatible toolchain

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.8 or newer
* C++11 toolchain compatible with CMake for your development platform (e.g. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows)
* [SystemAbstractions](https://github.com/rhymu8354/SystemAbstractions.git) - a
  cross-platform adapter library for system services whose APIs vary from one
  operating system to another

### Build system generation

Generate the build system using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) from the solution root.  For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A "x64" ..
```

### Compiling, linking, et cetera

Either use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or your toolchain's IDE to build.
For [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
